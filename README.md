One Ubuntu 20.04 server with a sudo non-root user and a firewall enabled. To set this up, you can follow our Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04
tutorial. We will refer to this as the OpenVPN Server throughout this guide.

A separate Ubuntu 20.04 server set up as a private Certificate Authority (CA), which we will refer to as the CA Server throughout this guide. After
executing the steps from the Initial Server Setup Guide on this server, you can follow steps 1 to 3 of our guide on How To Set Up and Configure a
Certificate Authority (CA) on Ubuntu 20.04 to accomplish that.
